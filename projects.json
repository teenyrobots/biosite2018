      "brief": "In the wake of the 2016 election, there was a huge discussion in the journalism community about how readers evaluate truth and trustworthiness in a news outlet. The client was interested in conducting a research project about readers’ ability to identify “truthiness” in a news story, and wanted to get as many plays as possible.",
      "product": "Using game design principles, we designed an interface that made news story evaluation fun. Users were presented with a new story, and a Tinder-like swipe mechanic let them designate a story as “real” or “fake” news.",
      "outcome": "Factitious was played over 1.6 million times in the first three days it was released and was covered in several major media outlets. The client was able to collect enough data for their own research, as well as ultimately making the core software available as an open source tool for playful polling systems."
