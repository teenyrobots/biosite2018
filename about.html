Alongside Editor + Publisher Erin Polgreen, she produced hundreds of pages of comics journalism with contributors from all over the world. Symbolia worked with other media organizations such as Tumblr, Popular Science, the Harvard Business Review, and more to bring interactive comics journalism to new audiences.</p>
