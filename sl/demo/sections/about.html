            SimpleLightbox is lightweight and responsive lightbox library based on jQuery api.
            Display images, galleries, videos or custom content and control your lightbox with easy to use api.
            It weighs less than 2KB.

            In order to stay true to its name simpleLightbox tries to delegate most of heavy work to browser
            native mechanisms and existing proven libraries.
            Almost everything regarding layout (positioning and resizing) and animations is CSS.
            Letting browser do it's own thing when possible seems like a good idea.
            <br><br>
            Library is internally using a available flavor of jQuery api implementation (jQuery, Zepto or simpleQuery)
            mostly for purposes of event normalization and simple Dom manipulation.
